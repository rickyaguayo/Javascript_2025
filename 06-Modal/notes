- .querySelector() only returns the first instance if there is one or more elements that can be selected by it
  - to access them all, .querySelectorAll() can be used and looped through all the instances

- .classList lets you modify the classes on an element with methods like .remove or .add
  - when using these methods, the class selector (.) is not required
  Ex: modal.classList.remove('hidden')

- keyboard events should be tied to the document
