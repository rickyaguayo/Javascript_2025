Javascript is:
- high-level: dont have to worry about complex stuff like memory managment
- object-oriented: based on objects for storing most kinds of data
- multi-paradigm: can use different types of programming styles
- programming language: instructs computers to do things
- has dynamic typing. dont have to define data type when storing. JS automatically does this
  - value holds the type, not the variable

7 Primitive Data types:
  1. number
  2. boolean
  3. string
  4. null
  5. undefined
  6. symbol
  7. BigInt

- when a variable is undefined, the data type is also undefined
  Ex: let year;
      console.log(year); // undefined
      console.log(typeof year); // undefined

- **: exponents (to the power of)
  - Ex: 2 ** 3 // 8

- There is precedence within operators. Math operators tends to have higher precedence than comparisons. Etc
- some operators run left to right and some are right to left
  - math will be left to right
  - assignements will be right to left
- a lot like math precedence (PEMDAS)
  - * and / will have a higher precedence than + and -

- template literals can only take expressions
