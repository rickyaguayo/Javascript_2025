strict mode:
  - must be on first line of file. anything before wont be strict
  - lets you write more secure code. forbids you to do certain things and helps bring up errors

- Function Declarations vs Expressions
  - declarations give the function itself a name
  - can be called before they are declared in the code
  Ex: function calcAge(birthYear){}

  - expressions are function value stored in a variable
  - cannot be called before being declared
  Ex: const calcAge = function (birthYear) {}

- Arrow functions
  - like function expressions
  Ex: const calcAge = birthYear => 2037 - birthYear
  - has explicit returns for one line arrow functions
