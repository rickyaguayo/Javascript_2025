Destructuring:
  - a way to unpack values from arrays or variables. breaks complex data structures down to simple structures
  - Destructuring assignment uses []
  Ex: const arr = [2, 3, 4]
  const [x, y, z] = arr 
  console.log(x, y, z) // 2 3 4
  - x, y and z take their values from the values in arr via destructuring
  - destructuring is always on the left side of the equal sign
  - destructuring doesnt change the original element

  - to skip an element while destructuring, add a blank placeholder
    Ex: const [x, , z] = arr // x = 2, z = 4
    - only x and z will be created from arr

  - variables can be created with destructuing via function calls
  Ex: const [starter, mainCourse] = restaurant.order(2, 0) 
  - starter and mainCourse will equal the return values of the function

  - destructuring nested arrays with inner destructuing assignments
  Ex: const nested = [2, 4, [5, 6]]
  const [i, , [j, k]] = nested // 2 5 6
  - without the inner destructuing assignment, j would equal the array element from the nested variable ([5 ,6])

  - set default values inside of a destructuing assignment with = 
  Ex: const [p = 1, q = 1, r = 1] = [8, 9];
  console.log(p, q, r); 
  - r remains its default because the array on the right doesnt have a 3rd element
  - without the defaults, r would return undefined
  - useful when data is being received from an API
